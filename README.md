# phosart-stash-template

This is a ready-to-use template using the phosart suite of libraries that emulates a sta.sh-y sort of art website.

To get started, all you need to do is clone the repo and double-click the "start.cmd" (windows), "start.command" (mac), or "start.sh" (linux) files, which will automatically download and install node and git portably alongside the files here, and open the editor environment in your browser.

(Note that on macOS you'll need the your developer tools installed. You can use `xcode-select --install` at the terminal to do this)
